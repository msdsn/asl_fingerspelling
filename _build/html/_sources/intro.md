# Asl model

The goal of this competition is to detect and translate American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling into text. You will create a model trained on the largest dataset of its kind, released specifically for this competition. The data includes more than three million fingerspelled characters produced by over 100 Deaf signers captured via the selfie camera of a smartphone with a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.

Your work may help move sign language recognition forward, making AI more accessible for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.
